# What is Wildcard?

Wildcard is an arbitrary project based on a concept we were assigned during Hack Highschool mentor program. Since I was assigned Python, this project was my introduction to the language, and an introduction to Pygame.

## Installation

To be able to run the game, make sure you have [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) installed on your computer. To install pygame, you can use the following command:

'''bash
$ python3 -m pip install --user pygame
'''

Once you have pygame installed, you can now run the game using the command below.

'''bash
python3 alien_invasion.py
'''
